Project: Portfolio Website with Advanced Animations
This is a personal portfolio website I created as part of my internship with CodTech. The goal was to build a modern, responsive website that not only shows my skills and projects but also includes advanced animations to make it stand out. I wanted this site to feel smooth, engaging, and professional—something I’d be proud to send to potential employers or showcase on social platforms.

The portfolio was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For the animations, I used GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) along with its ScrollTrigger plugin. These tools helped me bring the page to life with effects like smooth fade-ins, scroll-based animations, and interactive transitions. The animations are designed to guide the user’s attention, making the browsing experience more engaging without being too flashy or overwhelming.

To write and manage my code, I used Visual Studio Code as my development environment. Version control was handled with Git, and I’ve uploaded the project to GitHub so it can be easily accessed and updated in the future. The live version of the website is hosted using GitHub Pages. I made sure the site is fully responsive, so it works well on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

Tools & Technologies Used:
HTML5 – for structuring the content

CSS3 – for styling and layout

JavaScript (ES6+) 

GSAP & ScrollTrigger

VS Code – code editor


 Features:
Clean and minimal layout inspired by eat-curious.com

Section-based scroll animations and entrance effects

Animated navigation bar and smooth transitions

Responsive design for all devices

Sections include: Home, About Me, Skills, Projects, and Contact

Real-World Applications:
This kind of website can be used by:

Students or freshers applying for internships or jobs

Freelancers wanting to show their past work

Developers and designers looking to build a personal brand

Anyone in the creative or tech industry who wants a strong online presence

It’s also a great base template that can be customized and expanded later—adding blog sections, testimonials, or even integrating it with a backend if needed.

 What I Learned:
This project helped me understand the power of animation in web design. I learned how to use GSAP efficiently, how to manage animations based on scroll position, and how to optimize performance so animations don’t slow down the page.
